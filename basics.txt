1. Lag features are values at prior timesteps that are considered useful because they are created on the assumption that what happened in the past can influence or contain a sort of intrinsic information about the future. For example, it can be beneficial to generate features for sales that happened in previous days at 4:00 p.m. if you want to predict similar sales at 4:00 p.m. the next day.
